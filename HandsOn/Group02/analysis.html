	<h2>Analysis of the License</h2>
	<p> 
		Here there is an examination of the license of the data, ponting out who is the publisher of the dataset and its rightsholder, as well as the licence of the dataset. Moreover, the potential license to be used for the dataset to be generated is defined.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Righstholder: the Madrid City countil.</li>
		<li>Publisher: the Open Data Portal from the Madrid City Council.</li>
		<li>License: The general conditions of the license allow the reuse of documents for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Reuse is understood as the use of documents held by the Madrid City Council, provided that such use does not constitute a public administrative activity.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> 
		Consequently, the potencial license for the application needs to meet the following conditions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is forbidden to distort the meaning of the data.</li>
		<li>The source of the data to be reused must be cited (Madrid City Council).</li>
		<li>The date of the last update of the documents to be reused must be mentioned (only if it is included).</li>
		<li>It may not be indicated, implied or suggested that the source of the data participates, sponsors or supports the reuse that is carried out with the information.</li>
		<li>The metadata on the update date and the applicable reuse conditions included, when applicable, in the data made available for reuse must be kept, not altered or deleted.</li>
		<li>In the case of anonymized information for the protection of personal data or other reasons, it is expressly forbidden to carry out tasks of re-identification of people from these data and other possible, past, current or future sources of data and information.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Resource Naming Strategy</h2>
	<p>
	Since our data set is rather small, we will use hash URIs. 
	The URI domain to be used will be <http://MadridPublicContracts>, as it is directly related to the topic of our application.
	The classes in the model will follow the form: http://MadridPublicContracts/ontology/<ontologyName>#<className> .
	The properties in the model will follow the form http://MadridPublicContracts/ontology/<ontologyName>#<propertyName> .
	Instances in the ontology will have the form http://MadridPublicContracts/resource/<className>#<identifier> .

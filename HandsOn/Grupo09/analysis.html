Finally, the dataset referring to the minor contracts carried out in Madrid during the year 2020 has been chosen. 

The dataset is composed of 12 variables and 2654 records.

On the other hand, there is a field that indicates the name of the contracting sections, the contracting body (whether it is the director, coordinator, manager, etc.), the object of the contract which is of a different nature, specified by the field for the type of contract of a categorical nature (services, works, supplies or others) and the NIF corresponding to the contractor company (both character strings). 

Finally, there is the amount associated with the contract in question (numerical, in euros from 0€ as a collaboration generally, to 48.349,82€), the date of approval of the contract (approved in 2019), the term (also numerical, ranging from 0 to 12) and ends with the date of communication of the registration (from 2 of January 2020 to the 30 of June of this same year).

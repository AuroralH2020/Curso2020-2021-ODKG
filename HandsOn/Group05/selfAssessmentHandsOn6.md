## Comments on the self-assessment

Existing XML schemes of our dataset can be found [here](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/e-procurement/tedschemas).
Their namespace for publication is `http://publications.europa.eu/resource/schema/ted/R2.0.9/publication`.
To prevent potential conflicts, we did not use the exact same namespace, however it should be kept in mind for possible later linking.
For this assignment, we tried to re-use as most as possible from [lov](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov).
